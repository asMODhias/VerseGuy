# Getting Started — Verse Guy

Quick start:

1. Run `VerseguY.exe` (launcher). The launcher loads the native core DLL and starts the UI.
2. On first run, complete the onboarding flow and accept ToS where prompted.
3. Install or enable plugins from the Plugins tab.

Developer tips:

- For development, use `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/test.sh` to build and run tests cross-platform.
- Local-only users can use Local Auth for offline workflows.

See `README.md` for system requirements and installer instructions.
