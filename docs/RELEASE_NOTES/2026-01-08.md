## Release Notes (Unreleased snapshot — 2026-01-08)

What's new
----------
- Fleet Domain (TEIL 10): Implemented domain crate `crates/domain/fleet` with entities, repository, RocksDB storage adapter and `FleetService`. Added integration tests.
- Master-server: Exposed Fleet APIs (`POST /v1/fleets`, `GET /v1/fleets`, `GET /v1/fleets/{id}`, `POST /v1/fleets/{id}/ships`) with integration tests.
- Playwright E2E: Added `ui/web/e2e/fleet.spec.ts` and CI runs Playwright tests; CI will fail when Playwright tests fail to surface issues early.

Notes
-----
- Playwright tests are written to skip locally if services (UI or master-server) are unavailable. CI runs UI and master-server and will run E2E tests against them.
- See `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSEGUY_ENTERPRISE_GUIDE.md` for details and implementation notes.
