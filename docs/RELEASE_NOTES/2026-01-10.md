## Release Notes (Unreleased snapshot — 2026-01-10)

What's new
----------
- TEIL 12 (Application Services): Added `crates/domain/application` implementing basic CQRS patterns for application aggregates (create/get/list) with RocksDB storage adapter and unit + integration tests.
- API: Master-server exposes Application endpoints: `POST /v1/apps`, `GET /v1/apps`, `GET /v1/apps/{id}`.
- Playwright E2E: `ui/web/e2e/application.spec.ts` added (create + fetch) — CI runs E2E and surfaces failures.

Planned improvements (next steps)
-------------------------------
- Add update/delete commands and handlers for application resources (TEIL 12 extension).
- Expand E2E to cover update and delete flows and integrate them into CI.

Notes
-----
- Playwright tests skip locally when UI or master-server are not reachable; the CI job starts the services before running tests.
- See `VERSEGUY_ENTERPRISE_GUIDE.md` TEIL 12 for scope and acceptance criteria.
