## Release Notes (Unreleased snapshot — 2026-01-09)

What's new
----------
- Operations Domain (TEIL 11): Implemented domain crate `crates/domain/operations` with entities, repository, RocksDB storage adapter and `OperationsService`. Added integration tests and master-server handlers.
- Master-server: Exposed Operations APIs (`POST /v1/operations`, `GET /v1/operations`, `GET /v1/operations/{id}`, `POST /v1/operations/{id}/participants`, `POST /v1/operations/{id}/status`) with integration tests.
- Playwright E2E: Added `ui/web/e2e/operations.spec.ts` to cover Operations flows in CI.

Notes
-----
- Playwright tests skip locally if services (UI or master-server) are unavailable. CI will run UI and master-server and execute E2E tests.
- See `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSEGUY_ENTERPRISE_GUIDE.md` for details and implementation notes.
