This PR applies a temporary local patch to the workspace to remove the `ring 0.16.20` advisory (RUSTSEC-2025-0009) by adding a patched `rcgen` and a WIP `libp2p-tls` compatibility patch.\n\nWhat it includes:\n- `patches/rcgen`: local copy of `rcgen` updated to depend on `ring = "^0.17"` and small adjustments to build with the workspace.\n- `patches/libp2p-tls`: WIP compatibility adjustments to allow building against the updated `rcgen`.\n- `docs/security/RCGEN_PATCH_PLAN.md`: plan for upstream PR/fork and rollback instructions.\n\nVerification steps performed locally:\n- `cargo audit` now no longer reports RUSTSEC-2025-0009.\n- `cargo build` was executed; `libp2p-tls` still requires final API adaptation (WIP).\n\nNext actions:\n- Finalize `libp2p-tls` adaptations and/or open upstream PR to adjust the `libp2p-tls` code to new rcgen API.\n- After upstream merges, remove the `[patch.crates-io]` entries and update workspace.\n\nPlease review: this is marked security-critical; request review from the security/maintainers. If acceptable, we can open upstream PRs against `rcgen` and `rust-libp2p` (tls) from forks prepared under `asMODhias`.
